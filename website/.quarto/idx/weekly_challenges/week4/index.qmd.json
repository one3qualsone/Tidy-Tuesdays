This dataset is inspired by the concept of \"Moneyball\" (made famous in baseball analytics) but applied to the fictional world of Marvel's mutants.\n\nThe X-Men, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1963, have been a staple of Marvel Comics for decades. This analysis looks at which characters appeared most frequently throughout different eras, tracking the popularity and evolution of the team's roster over three decades.\n\n## The Data\n\nThe dataset contains information on each X-Men character's appearances across different decades, including:\n\n- Character names\n- Total appearances\n- Appearances per decade (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s)\n- First appearance date\n\nLet's first take a look at the data structure:\n\n```{r}\n# Display structure in a more readable format\nstr(mutant_moneyball[, 1:7])  # Only showing first 7 columns for clarity\n```\n\nAnd now let's see the first few rows of the data:\n\n```{r}\n# View the first few rows\nhead(mutant_moneyball[, 1:7]) %>%  # Only showing first 7 columns for clarity\n  kable() %>%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\"), full_width = FALSE)\n```\n\n## Data Preparation\n\nThe character names in the dataset use CamelCase format (e.g., \"ProfessorX\"). Let's create a function to format these names for better readability in our visualizations:\n\n```{r}\n# Function to format names\nformat_names <- function(name) {\n  words <- str_split(name, \"(?=[A-Z])\")[[1]]\n  capitalized_words <- str_to_title(words)\n  formatted_name <- paste(capitalized_words, collapse = \" \")\n  return(formatted_name)\n}\n\n# Apply the function to format character names using sapply instead of map_chr\nmutant_moneyball <- mutant_moneyball %>%\n  mutate(Member = sapply(Member, format_names))\n\n# Check the formatted names\nhead(mutant_moneyball$Member)\n```\n\n## Most Frequent X-Men Characters\n\nLet's first look at which X-Men characters appeared most frequently in comics during this period:\n\n```{r}\n# Select and reorder based on total issues\nmutant_moneyball_TI <- mutant_moneyball %>%\n  select(Member, TotalIssues) %>%\n  arrange(desc(TotalIssues)) %>%\n  mutate(Member = factor(Member, levels = unique(Member)))\n\n# Display top 10 characters\nmutant_moneyball_TI %>%\n  head(10) %>%\n  kable(col.names = c(\"Character\", \"Total Appearances\"),\n        caption = \"Top 10 X-Men Characters by Number of Appearances (1963-1992)\") %>%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\"), full_width = FALSE)\n```\n\n## Visualizing Total Appearances\n\nNow, let's create a visualization showing the total comic appearances for each X-Men character:\n\n```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=10}\n# Create plot of total issues per member\np1 <- ggplot(mutant_moneyball_TI, aes(x = Member, y = TotalIssues, fill = TotalIssues)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"yellow\", high = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Tallying the total comic book appearances of X-men icons (1963-1992)\",\n       subtitle = \"Total comic book appearances of each X-Men character\",\n       x = \"X-Men Member\",\n       y = \"Total Issues\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.2, size = 12, color = \"white\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(color = \"white\", size = 12),\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"black\"),\n    text = element_text(color = \"white\"),\n    panel.background = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks = element_line(color = \"white\"),\n    plot.margin = margin(1, 0.5, 1, 0.5, \"cm\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"italic\")\n  ) +\n  guides(fill = \"none\")\n\n# Display the plot\np1\n```\n\nThe visualization clearly shows that certain characters like Professor X, Cyclops, and Storm have significantly more appearances than others, reflecting their importance as core team members.\n\n## Appearances Over Time\n\nNext, let's analyze how the appearances of the most popular X-Men characters changed over the decades from the 1960s to the 1990s:\n\n```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=12}\n# Look at the appearances of the most popular members over time\nmutant_moneyball_decades <- mutant_moneyball %>%\n  filter(TotalIssues > 100) %>% \n  arrange(desc(TotalIssues)) %>%\n  mutate(Member = factor(Member, levels = unique(Member))) %>%\n  select(Member, TotalIssues60s, TotalIssues70s, TotalIssues80s, TotalIssues90s) %>%\n  rename(\"1960\" = TotalIssues60s, \"1970\" = TotalIssues70s, \"1980\" = TotalIssues80s, \"1990\" = TotalIssues90s) %>%\n  gather('1960', '1970', '1980', '1990', key = \"Decade\", value = \"TotalIssues\") %>%\n  arrange(Member) %>%\n  mutate(Decade = as.numeric(Decade))\n\n# Create a line plot showing appearances over time for each popular character\np2 <- ggplot(mutant_moneyball_decades, aes(x = Decade, y = TotalIssues)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.5, color = \"yellow\") +\n  geom_point(size = 3, color = \"red\") +\n  facet_wrap(~Member, ncol = 5) +\n  labs(title = \"Most popular X-Men character appearances (1963-1992)\",\n       subtitle = \"Distribution of appearances for X-Men characters with over 100 total appearances\",\n       caption = \"Tidy Tuesday 2024 Week 12 | Data: Rally's Mutant Moneyball | Viz: Annabel Smith\",\n       x = \"Decade\",\n       y = \"Total Issues\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"white\", size = 12),\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"black\"),\n    text = element_text(color = \"white\"),\n    panel.background = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks = element_line(color = \"white\"),\n    plot.margin = margin(1, 0.5, 1, 0.5,\"cm\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"italic\"),\n    panel.spacing.x = unit(1, \"cm\"), \n    panel.spacing.y = unit(2, \"cm\"),\n    strip.text = element_text(color = \"white\", face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    strip.background = element_rect(color = NA, fill = \"red\")\n  )\n\n# Display the plot\np2\n```\n\n## Character Appearances by Decade\n\nTo better understand how the X-Men roster evolved over time, let's analyze the distribution of appearances across decades:\n\n```{r}\n# Calculate the percentage of appearances in each decade\ndecade_summary <- mutant_moneyball %>%\n  filter(TotalIssues > 50) %>%\n  mutate(\n    Pct60s = TotalIssues60s / TotalIssues * 100,\n    Pct70s = TotalIssues70s / TotalIssues * 100,\n    Pct80s = TotalIssues80s / TotalIssues * 100,\n    Pct90s = TotalIssues90s / TotalIssues * 100\n  ) %>%\n  select(Member, TotalIssues, Pct60s, Pct70s, Pct80s, Pct90s) %>%\n  arrange(desc(TotalIssues))\n\n# Display the distribution of appearances\ndecade_summary %>%\n  head(10) %>%\n  mutate(\n    Pct60s = round(Pct60s, 1),\n    Pct70s = round(Pct70s, 1),\n    Pct80s = round(Pct80s, 1),\n    Pct90s = round(Pct90s, 1)\n  ) %>%\n  kable(col.names = c(\"Character\", \"Total Appearances\", \"1960s (%)\", \"1970s (%)\", \"1980s (%)\", \"1990s (%)\"),\n        caption = \"Percentage of Appearances by Decade for Top X-Men Characters\") %>%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\"), full_width = FALSE) %>%\n  row_spec(1:3, background = \"#FFF8DC\")\n```\n\n## Combined Visualization\n\nFinally, let's combine our visualizations to create a comprehensive view of X-Men character appearances:\n\n```{r fig.height=18, fig.width=12}\n# Combine the two plots\ncombined_plots <- p1 / p2\n\n# Display the combined visualization\ncombined_plots\n```\n\n## Key Findings\n\nFrom our analysis of the X-Men comic book appearances from 1963 to 1992, we can observe several interesting patterns:\n\n1. **Core Team Members**: Professor X, Cyclops, and Storm stand out as the most frequently appearing characters, reflecting their roles as core team members and leaders throughout the X-Men's history.\n\n2. **Generational Shifts**: The data reveals clear generational shifts in the X-Men roster. Original team members like Cyclops and Beast were prominent in the 1960s, while characters like Storm, Colossus, and Wolverine rose to prominence in the late 1970s and 1980s.\n\n3. **1980s Explosion**: There was a significant increase in appearances for most characters during the 1980s, corresponding to the era when the X-Men became one of Marvel's most popular franchises, particularly after the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" and introduction of characters like Wolverine.\n\n4. **Evolving Team Dynamics**: While some characters like Professor X maintained relatively consistent appearances across all decades, others show more variable patterns, reflecting changing team rosters and storylines.\n\n5. **Rise of Wolverine**: Despite not being an original team member, Wolverine quickly became one of the most featured characters after his introduction, highlighting his rapid rise to popularity.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis analysis provides insights into the evolution of the X-Men team over three critical decades of their publication history. The visualization techniques used here could be applied to other media franchises to track character popularity and narrative focus over time.\n\nThe clear generational shifts visible in the data reflect not only the evolving storylines within the X-Men universe but also changing editorial directions and reader preferences. Characters who maintained high appearance rates across multiple decades can be seen as the backbone of the franchise, while those with more concentrated appearances might represent specific eras or storytelling approaches.\n\nFor future analysis, it would be interesting to correlate these appearance counts with other metrics such as comic book sales figures, character introduction dates, or major storyline events to gain deeper insights into what drove the popularity of certain characters during specific time periods.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [TidyTuesday GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2024/2024-03-19)\n- [Original Data Source: Rally's Mutant Moneyball](https://rally.io/creator/COMIC/)\n- [Marvel Comics Database](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Marvel_Database)\n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\n# Save thumbnail for the listing page\np_thumbnail <- ggplot(mutant_moneyball_TI %>% head(10), aes(x = reorder(Member, TotalIssues), y = TotalIssues, fill = TotalIssues)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"yellow\", high = \"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 X-Men by Comic Appearances\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"black\"),\n    text = element_text(color = \"white\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"white\"),\n    panel.grid = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  guides(fill = \"none\")\n\nggsave(\"thumbnail.png\", plot = p_thumbnail, width = 6, height = 4)\n```","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(stringr)  # For str_split function\n\n# Read data directly from TidyTuesday GitHub repository\nmutant_moneyball <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-03-19/mutant_moneyball.csv')\n```\n\n## Introduction\n\nFor this week's Tidy Tuesday, I explored the \"Mutant Moneyball\" dataset, which catalogs the appearances of X-Men characters in comic books from 1963 to 1992.
