## What is Tidy Tuesday?

[Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. As stated in the R for Data Science Online Learning Community's GitHub repo:

> The intent of Tidy Tuesday is to provide a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their wrangling and data visualization skills independently and in public.

Every week, a new dataset is posted, and participants explore and visualize the data, sharing their creations with the community.

## About This Site

This site showcases my weekly explorations and visualizations for the Tidy Tuesday challenges. Each week, I explore a different dataset, trying new techniques, packages, and visualization approaches.

My goals with this project are to:

1. **Improve my R programming skills** - particularly with the tidyverse ecosystem
2. **Enhance my data visualization repertoire** - learning new techniques and design principles
3. **Practice data storytelling** - finding meaningful insights in data and conveying them effectively
4. **Contribute to the R community** - sharing code and visualizations that others might learn from

## About Me

When I'm not analyzing data, I [other interests or hobbies].

## Technical Details

This site is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), a open-source scientific and technical publishing system. It's hosted on Azure Static Web Apps and automatically deployed through GitHub Actions.

The code for all analyses is available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yourusername/tidy-tuesdays).
