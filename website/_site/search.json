Original team members like Cyclops and Beast were prominent in the 1960s, while characters like Storm, Colossus, and Wolverine rose to prominence in the late 1970s and 1980s.\n1980s Explosion: There was a significant increase in appearances for most characters during the 1980s, corresponding to the era when the X-Men became one of Marvel’s most popular franchises, particularly after the “Dark Phoenix Saga” and introduction of characters like Wolverine.\nEvolving Team Dynamics: While some characters like Professor X maintained relatively consistent appearances across all decades, others show more variable patterns, reflecting changing team rosters and storylines.\nRise of Wolverine: Despite not being an original team member, Wolverine quickly became one of the most featured characters after his introduction, highlighting his rapid rise to popularity."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis analysis provides insights into the evolution of the X-Men team over three critical decades of their publication history. The visualization techniques used here could be applied to other media franchises to track character popularity and narrative focus over time.\nThe clear generational shifts visible in the data reflect not only the evolving storylines within the X-Men universe but also changing editorial directions and reader preferences. Characters who maintained high appearance rates across multiple decades can be seen as the backbone of the franchise, while those with more concentrated appearances might represent specific eras or storytelling approaches.\nFor future analysis, it would be interesting to correlate these appearance counts with other metrics such as comic book sales figures, character introduction dates, or major storyline events to gain deeper insights into what drove the popularity of certain characters during specific time periods."
