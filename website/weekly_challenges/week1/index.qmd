## Introduction

This week's Tidy Tuesday featured the Palmer Penguins dataset, which includes size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

## Initial Data Exploration

Let's look at the first few rows of the dataset:

```{r}
# Using kable for better table formatting
head(df) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), full_width = FALSE)
```

## Key Variables

The dataset includes several key measurements:
- Bill length (mm)
- Bill depth (mm)
- Flipper length (mm)
- Body mass (g)

## Visualising Penguin Bill Dimensions

Let's create a scatter plot showing the relationship between bill length and bill depth, colored by species:

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = `Bill Length (mm)`, y = `Bill Depth (mm)`, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Penguin Bill Dimensions by Species",
       x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Enhanced Visualisation

Here's an enhanced version with trend lines to better visualise the relationship:

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = `Bill Length (mm)`, y = `Bill Depth (mm)`, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Penguin Bill Dimensions by Species (with trend lines)",
       x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Exploring Species Distribution by Island

Let's look at how the penguin species are distributed across the islands:

```{r}
# Create a summary table of species by island
species_by_island <- df %>%
  count(Species, Island) %>%
  spread(Island, n, fill = 0)

# Display as a nicely formatted table
species_by_island %>%
  kable(caption = "Penguin Species Distribution by Island") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), full_width = FALSE)
```

## Conclusion

This exploration demonstrates how simple visualisations can reveal clear patterns in biological data. The distinct clustering of penguin species based on bill dimensions shows how these measurements can be used for species identification.
