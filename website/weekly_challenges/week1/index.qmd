```

## Introduction

This week's Tidy Tuesday featured the Palmer Penguins dataset, which includes size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

## Initial Data Exploration

Let's look at the first few rows of the dataset:

```{r}
head(df)
```

## Key Variables

The dataset includes several key measurements:

- Bill length (mm)
- Bill depth (mm)
- Flipper length (mm)
- Body mass (g)

## Visualizing Penguin Bill Dimensions

Let's create a scatter plot showing the relationship between bill length and bill depth, colored by species:

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = `Bill Length (mm)`, y = `Bill Depth (mm)`, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Penguin Bill Dimensions by Species",
       x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Interactive Version

Below is an interactive version of this visualization where you can select different measurements to compare:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Display a static version of the plot for the website
# In a real implementation, you'd render the interactive app to an iframe
# using knitr::include_app() or similar

ggplot(df, aes(x = `Bill Length (mm)`, y = `Bill Depth (mm)`, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Penguin Bill Dimensions by Species (with trend lines)",
       subtitle = "Interactive version available in the Shiny app",
       x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

For the full interactive experience, [launch the Shiny app](https://yourusername.shinyapps.io/week1-penguins/).

## Analysis

From our visualization, we can observe:

1. There's a clear separation between the species based on bill dimensions
2. Gentoo penguins have longer, narrower bills
3. Adelie penguins have shorter, deeper bills
4. Chinstrap penguins fall somewhere in between 

## Conclusion

This exploration demonstrates how simple visualizations can reveal clear patterns in biological data. The distinct clustering of penguin species based on bill dimensions shows how these measurements can be used for species identification.
