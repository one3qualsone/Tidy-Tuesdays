## Introduction

This week's Tidy Tuesday focused on global air quality data. Air pollution is a major environmental risk to health worldwide, with outdoor air pollution responsible for millions of deaths annually. Understanding air quality trends across major cities can help inform policy decisions and public health initiatives.

## The Data

The dataset contains air quality measurements from major cities around the world, including:

- Air Quality Index (AQI)
- PM2.5 levels (fine particulate matter)
- PM10 levels (coarse particulate matter)
- NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) levels

Let's take a look at the first few rows:

```{r}
head(air_quality)
```

## Air Quality Over Time

Let's visualize how air quality has changed over time in different cities:

```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=10}
ggplot(air_quality, aes(x = date, y = aqi, color = city)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~city, ncol = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Air Quality Index Over Time",
    subtitle = "January - March 2024",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Air Quality Index (AQI)",
    color = "City"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    strip.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue", color = NA),
    strip.text = element_text(face = "bold")
  )
```

## Comparing Pollutant Levels

Let's compare the different pollutant levels across cities:

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
air_quality %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_aqi = mean(aqi),
    avg_pm25 = mean(pm25),
    avg_pm10 = mean(pm10),
    avg_no2 = mean(no2)
  ) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("avg_"),
    names_to = "pollutant",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    pollutant = case_when(
      pollutant == "avg_aqi" ~ "Air Quality Index",
      pollutant == "avg_pm25" ~ "PM2.5",
      pollutant == "avg_pm10" ~ "PM10",
      pollutant == "avg_no2" ~ "NO2"
    )
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(city, value), y = value, fill = city)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~pollutant, scales = "free_y", ncol = 2) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Average Pollutant Levels by City",
    subtitle = "January - March 2024",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Concentration"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    strip.background = element_rect(fill = "lightgray", color = NA),
    strip.text = element_text(face = "bold")
  )
```

## Air Quality Category Distribution

Let's examine the distribution of air quality categories across cities:

```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=10}
air_quality %>%
  count(city, quality_category) %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city, y = percentage, fill = quality_category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "Good" = "#00E400",
      "Moderate" = "#FFFF00",
      "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" = "#FF7E00",
      "Unhealthy" = "#FF0000",
      "Very Unhealthy" = "#99004C"
    )
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Air Quality Categories by City",
    subtitle = "January - March 2024",
    x = "City",
    y = "Percentage",
    fill = "Air Quality Category"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    legend.position = "right"
  )
```

## Correlation Between Pollutants

Let's explore the correlation between different pollutants:

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
air_quality %>%
  select(aqi, pm25, pm10, no2) %>%
  cor() %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column("pollutant1") %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(-pollutant1, names_to = "pollutant2", values_to = "correlation") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pollutant1, y = pollutant2, fill = correlation)) +
  geom_tile() +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(correlation, 2)), color = "white", size = 4) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue", mid = "white", high = "red", midpoint = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Correlation Between Pollutants",
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,
    fill = "Correlation"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    panel.grid = element_blank()
  )
```

## Key Findings

From our analysis, we can observe:

1. **City Differences**: Beijing shows the highest average AQI levels, followed by Tokyo and New York.
2. **Pollutant Relationships**: PM10 and AQI show the strongest correlation, which is expected as PM10 is a major component of air quality calculations.
3. **Seasonal Patterns**: All cities show some fluctuation in air quality over the period, with some improvement trends visible in specific cities.
4. **Quality Categories**: London has the highest percentage of "Good" air quality days, while Beijing has the highest percentage of "Unhealthy" days.

## Conclusions

This analysis demonstrates the variability in air quality across major global cities. The data shows that while some cities struggle with consistently poor air quality, others maintain relatively good air quality levels throughout the period. These findings highlight the need for continued monitoring and targeted interventions in cities with persistent air quality issues.

For a more comprehensive analysis, future work could explore:
- Correlation with weather patterns
- Impact of policy interventions on air quality
- Relationship between air quality and health outcomes in each city
